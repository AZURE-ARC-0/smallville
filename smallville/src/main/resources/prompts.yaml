    First, decide whether or not {{agent.name}} is going to initiate a conversation.

    If {{agent.name}} is not going to initiate a conversation respond with "No conversation"

    Otherwise, create a fake conversation between {{agent.name}} and {{other.name}}

    For example, a conversation between people named A and B would look like this

    A: Hello, how are you today?
    B: I am good, and you?
