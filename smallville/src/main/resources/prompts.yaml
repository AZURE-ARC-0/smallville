    (e.g., brushing teeth, making bed) and 10 is extremely poignant (e.g., a break up, college
    acceptance), rate the likely poignancy of the following pieces of memory. Always answer with only a list of numbers. For example, if given the following memories Memories: John did nothing; John lin went to school; John lin saw a concert
    respond with [1, 2, 6]. If just given one memory still respond in a list. Memories are separated by semi colans (;)
